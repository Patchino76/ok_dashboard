# Final Fix - Using min_value and max_value from API

## Problem Identified

The API response includes both:
- `percentiles` object with keys like "5", "25", "50", "75", "95"
- **`min_value`** and **`max_value`** as direct properties

The code was trying to extract percentiles from a nested structure, but it's much simpler to use `min_value` and `max_value` directly!

## Solution

Changed the dashboard to use `dist.min_value` and `dist.max_value` directly:

```typescript
const minVal = dist.min_value;  // e.g., 158.68 for Ore
const maxVal = dist.max_value;  // e.g., 211.99 for Ore
const median = dist.median;     // e.g., 207.47 for Ore
```

## What You'll See Now

Based on your API response for **Ore**:
- **Lower bound line** at 158.68 (min_value)
- **Upper bound line** at 211.99 (max_value)
- **Shaded amber area** between them
- **Median line** at 207.47

For **WaterMill**:
- **Lower bound** at 7.12
- **Upper bound** at 22.81
- **Shaded area** between them
- **Median** at 17.81

## Visual Result

```

  │  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─  ← 158.68 (min_value) - Lower bound

```

## Code Changes

**Before (trying to extract percentiles):**
```typescript
const p5 = dist.percentiles["5"] || dist.percentiles["5.0"] || dist.min_value;
const p95 = dist.percentiles["95"] || dist.percentiles["95.0"] || dist.max_value;
```

**After (using min/max directly):**
```typescript
const minVal = dist.min_value;  // Direct access
const maxVal = dist.max_value;  // Direct access
```

## Console Output

You should now see:
```
📊 Distribution for Ore: {
  min: 158.68392460317764,
  max: 211.99627731853894,
  median: 207.47155470945927,
  sample_count: 131
}

✅ MV Ore has distribution percentiles: {
  p5: 158.68,
  p25: 171.99,
  p50: 207.47,
  p75: 198.33,
  p95: 211.99
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Direct property access** - No nested object navigation
2. **Always present** - min_value and max_value are always in the response
3. **Simple validation** - Just check if they're numbers and min < max
4. **Clear bounds** - Shows the full range of successful trials

## Expected Result

After refreshing:
- **Two thin dashed lines** marking min and max values
- **Shaded area** (amber for MV, blue for CV) between the lines
- **Median line** in the middle
- **Labels** showing the actual values

The shading will show the **full range of parameter values** from all 131 successful trials that achieved the target!

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Run optimization** again
3. **Check console** for the distribution logs
4. **Look for shaded areas** between the dashed bound lines

This should definitely work now since we're using the exact values from the API response!
