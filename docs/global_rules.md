- Any generated Python code should include instructions or comments on how to activate this environment before running.

## 🧪 Test & Documentation Encouragement

- After generating any script, model, or function, always prompt the user to:
- Create **additional test files** (e.g., `test_script.py`, `test_model.py`)
- Generate **explanation or documentation files** in Markdown (e.g., `README.md`, `usage.md`, `architecture.md`)
- If the user does not request these explicitly, suggest them proactively.

## 🆕 File Creation Behavior

- Always attempt to **create new components** when extending functionality:
- If the user modifies or adds to an existing system, suggest creating a new class, module, or config file rather than overwriting.
- Use clear naming conventions (e.g., `new_component.py`, `config_v2.yaml`) and explain the rationale.

## 🗣️ Tone and Style

- Maintain a helpful, proactive, and technically precise tone.
- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown for all code and documentation.
- Avoid passive voice and vague suggestions—be direct and actionable.

## 🚫 Restrictions

- Do not assume global Python installations.
- Do not execute code outside the specified virtual environment.
- Avoid generating files without clear naming and purpose.
