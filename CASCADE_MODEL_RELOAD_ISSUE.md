# Cascade Model Reload Issue - 2025-10-01 15:00

## Problem

You trained a **new model WITHOUT DVs** but still getting the error:
```
Feature names seen at fit time, yet now missing:
- Daiki
- Grano  
- Shisti
```

## Root Cause

The **server is using an old model in memory** that expects DVs, even though the **new model on disk** doesn't have DVs.

### Timeline

1. **14:40:36** - New model trained WITHOUT DVs ‚úÖ
   - DV features: `[]` (empty)
   - Quality model inputs: Only CVs (3 features)
   - R¬≤ Score: 0.386

2. **Current** - Server still using old model WITH DVs ‚ùå
   - Old model expects: CVs + DVs (6 features)
   - Predictions fail because DVs are missing

### Why This Happens

When you train a model in **background tasks**, the `model_manager` global variable is NOT automatically updated. The training:
1. ‚úÖ Saves new model files to disk
2. ‚ùå Does NOT reload them into memory
3. ‚ùå Server continues using old model

---

## Solution

### Option 1: Restart the Server (Easiest)

Simply **restart the API server**:
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
python python/api.py
```

On startup, it will load the latest model from disk.

### Option 2: Call Reload Endpoint

Without restarting, reload the model via API:

```bash
# Run the reload script
python test_reload_mill6_model.py
```

Or manually:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ml/cascade/models/6/load
```

---

## Verification

### Check What Model is Loaded

After reloading, run:
```bash
python check_mill6_metadata.py
```

Should show:
```
‚úÖ Model does NOT expect DVs
   Predictions should work without DV values

Total input features: 3
Features: ['PulpHC', 'DensityHC', 'PressureHC']
```

### Test Prediction

After reloading, predictions should work WITHOUT DVs:
```json
{
  "mv_values": {"Ore": 180, "WaterMill": 15, ...},
  "dv_values": {}  // Empty is OK now!
}
```

---

## Permanent Fix (Already Applied)

Added **auto-reload after training** in `cascade_endpoints.py`:

```python
# After training completes
model_manager.load_models()  # ‚≠ê Reload models into memory
print("‚úÖ Models reloaded successfully - ready for predictions")
```

This ensures **future training** automatically updates the in-memory model.

**But** this doesn't help with the **current session** - you still need to reload manually or restart.

---

## Understanding the Issue

### What Happened

1. You trained a model WITH DVs (earlier)
2. Server loaded that model into memory
3. You trained a NEW model WITHOUT DVs
4. New model saved to disk ‚úÖ
5. Server still using OLD model in memory ‚ùå

### The Fix

**Reload the model** to sync memory with disk:
- Disk: New model (no DVs)
- Memory: Old model (with DVs) ‚Üê **This is the problem**
- After reload: Memory = Disk ‚úÖ

---

## Quick Steps

1. **Run the reload script**:
   ```bash
   python test_reload_mill6_model.py
   ```

2. **Expected output**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Models loaded successfully for Mill 6
   
   üìä Feature Configuration:
     DV features: []
   
   üéØ Quality Model:
     Input vars: ['PulpHC', 'DensityHC', 'PressureHC']
     Total features: 3
   
   ‚úÖ Model does NOT include DVs
      Predictions should work WITHOUT DV values
   ```

3. **Refresh your browser** to clear any cached state

4. **Try prediction again** - should work now! ‚úÖ

## Why Auto-Reload Doesn't Help Now

The auto-reload fix I added will help **future training sessions**, but:
- It only reloads **after training completes**
- Your training already completed (at 14:40:36)
- The auto-reload ran then, but you're still in the same server session
- The `model_manager` global variable persists until server restart

**Solution**: Manual reload or server restart is still needed for **this session**.

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **New model trained** - WITHOUT DVs (14:40:36)  
‚ùå **Server not updated** - Still using old model WITH DVs  
üîß **Fix**: Run `python test_reload_mill6_model.py`  
üéØ **Result**: Predictions will work WITHOUT DVs  

**Action**: Reload the model, then predictions should work!
